# Del-Mundo-Clarissa-portfolio-
Creating my portfolio was both a rewarding and challenging experience. At the start, I encountered several problems that made the process difficult. One of the main issues was the lack of equipment, since I did not always have access to a reliable computer and other necessary tools. Time management was also a big challenge because I had to balance my other tasks and responsibilities while working on this project. In addition, unstable internet connection slowed me down and sometimes interrupted my work, which made me feel frustrated and stressed. With all of these problems happening at the same time, I thought it would be very hard for me to finish the portfolio on time.Fortunately, I was not alone in this journey. My friends were very supportive and helped me understand parts that I found confusing. They also encouraged me when I was starting to lose motivation, which gave me the confidence to continue. By seeking help, staying patient, and pushing through the obstacles, I was able to complete the portfolio without worrying too much.Looking forward, I believe I can still improve my portfolio in the next version. I want to make the design more creative and personalized to reflect my skills better. I also plan to add more projects and interactive features that can showcase my growth as a developer. With better time management, stronger focus, and continuous learning, I am confident my future portfolio will be more polished and professional.
